									<h5>Palm Reading</h5>
<p>Also known as palmistry or chiromancy, palm reading is practiced all over the world with roots in Indian astrology and gypsy fortune-telling. The objective is to evaluate a person’s character and aspects of their life by studying the palm of their hand.</p>
<p>There is no substantiate evidence of correlation between palm features and psychological traits; palm reading is for entertainment purposes.</p>

<h5>Getting Started</h5>
<p>Which hand to read? There are two main practices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For males, the left hand is what you’re born with, and the right is what you’ve accumulated throughout your life. For females, it’s the opposite.</li>
  <li>Your dominant hand (the hand you use most often) determines your future and your other, non-dominant hand, is used to determine the past or hidden traits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take these into consideration when choosing which hand to read.</p>

<h5>Reading the Primary Lines of your Hand</h5>

<h5>1. Interpret the Heart Line</h5>
<p>This line is believed to indicate emotional stability, romantic perspectives, depression, and cardiac health.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Begins below the index finger = content with love life</li>
  <li>Begins below the middle finger = selfish when it comes to love</li>
  <li>Begins in-between the middle and index fingers = caring and understanding</li>
  <li>Is straight and short = less interest in romance</li>
  <li>Touches life line = heart is broken easily</li>
  <li>Is long and curvy = freely expresses emotions and feelings</li>
  <li>Is straight and parallel to the head line = good handle on emotions</li>
  <li>Is wavy = many relationships, absence of serious relationships</li>
  <li>Circle on the line = sad or depressed</li>
  <li>Broken line = emotional trauma</li>
</ul>

<h5>2. Examine the Head Line</h5>
<p>This line represents learning style, communication style, intellectualism, and thirst for knowledge.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Short line = prefers physical achievements over mental ones</li>
  <li>Curved, sloping line = creativity</li>
  <li>Curves downward = inclination towards literature and fantasy</li>
  <li>Curves upwards towards little finger = aptitude for math, business, and logic</li>
  <li>Separated from life line = adventure, enthusiasm for life</li>
  <li>Wavy line = short attention span</li>
  <li>Deep, long line = thinking is clear and focused</li>
  <li>Straight line = thinks realistically</li>
  <li>Broken head line = inconsistencies in thought or has varying interests</li>
  <li>Multiple crosses through head line = momentous decisions</li>
</ul>

<h5>3. Evaluate the Life Line</h5>
<p>This line reflects physical health, general well being, and major life changes. The length is not associated with length of life.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Runs close to thumb = often tired</li>
  <li>Curves completely around the thumb = good physical and mental health</li>
  <li>Forked upwards = positive attitude towards life</li>
  <li>Forked downwards = pessimist</li>
  <li>Curvy = plenty of energy</li>
  <li>Forms a semicircle = enthusiastic and courageous</li>
  <li>Long and deep = vitality</li>
  <li>Short and shallow = manipulated by others</li>
  <li>Swoops around in a semicircle = strength and enthusiasm</li>
  <li>Straight and close to the edge of the palm = cautious when it comes to relationships</li>
  <li>Ends at base of index finger = academic achievement</li>
  <li>Ends at base of pinky finger = success in business</li>
  <li>Ends at base of ring finger = sign of wealth</li>
  <li>Ends below the thumb = strong attachment with family</li>
  <li>Multiple life lines = extra vitality</li>
  <li>Circle in line = hospitalized or injured</li>
  <li>Break in line = sudden change of lifestyle</li>
  <li>No line = nervous</li>
</ul>

<h5>4. Study the Fate Line</h5>
<p>This line indicates the degree to which a person’s life is affected by external circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deep line = strongly controlled by fate</li>
  <li>Unbroken and runs straight across = successful life ahead</li>
  <li>Breaks and changes of direction = prone to many changes in life from external forces</li>
  <li>Fork in the line = great amount of wealth ahead</li>
  <li>Starts joined to life line = self-made individual; develops aspirations early on</li>
  <li>Joins with life line somewhere in the middle = signifies a point at which one’s interests must be surrendered to those of others</li>
  <li>Starts at base of thumb and crosses life line = support offered by family and friends</li>
  <li>No line = comfortable but uneventful life ahead</li>
</ul>

<h5>Determine the Hand Shape</h5>
<p>The length of the palm is measured from the wrist to the bottom of the fingers.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Earth”</strong> has broad, square palms and fingers, thick or coarse skin, is ruddy in color, and the length of the palm equals the length of fingers.
    <ul>
      <li>Solid values and energy, sometimes stubborn</li>
      <li>Practical and responsible, sometimes materialistic</li>
      <li>Work with their hands, comfortable with the tangible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>“Air”</strong> has square or rectangular palms with long fingers and sometimes protruding knuckles, low-set thumbs, dry skin, and length of the palm is less than the length of fingers.
    <ul>
      <li>Sociable, talkative, and witty</li>
      <li>Can be shallow, spiteful, and cold</li>
      <li>Comfortable with the mental and the intangible</li>
      <li>Does things in different and radical ways</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>“Water”</strong> has long, sometimes oval-shaped palm, with long, flexible, conical fingers; length of palm equals length of fingers.
    <ul>
      <li>Creative, perceptive, and sympathetic</li>
      <li>Can be moody, emotional, and inhibited</li>
      <li>Introverts</li>
      <li>Do things quietly and intuitively</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>“Fire”</strong> has square or rectangular palm, flushed or pink skin, and shorter fingers; length of palm is greater than length of fingers.
    <ul>
      <li>Spontaneous, enthusiastic, and optimistic</li>
      <li>Sometimes egotistical, impulsive, and insensitive</li>
      <li>Extroverts</li>
      <li>Do things boldly and instinctively</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now take a look at your hand and see what palmistry would say about you. What does palmistry say about someone else? Does it seem to match what you know about yourself or that person?</p>
<p>There is a lot more to palmistry than what is laid out here. How do you think palmistry was developed? If you’re interested in learning more, just do some research!</p>
